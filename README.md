## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
DoubleCookies here â€” person who loves programming, eating cookies, check statistics and other things!

### Skills
- Mostly know Java and Java frameworks (Spring Boot); also things for testing (Junit, Mockito);
- Have some experience with JS, TS and frameworks (React);
- Also studied C# and *scary* things like C++ and ASM but almost don't use it.

### What I'm working on GitHub
- Interesting and a bit funny projects like [WAT increment](https://doublecookies.github.io/wat-increment) and [MazeGeneratorAndSolver](https://github.com/DoubleCookies/MazeGeneratorAndSolver);
- *Game-connected* projects like [sendou.ink](https://github.com/Sendouc/sendou.ink) and [Switch-Screenshots](https://github.com/RenanGreca/Switch-Screenshots);
- Projects connected with FANDOM â€” [Wiki WAM Log](https://github.com/DoubleCookies/wiki-wam-log), [stats4wiki](https://github.com/DoubleCookies/stats4wiki).

### Future plans
- Improving existing repos (and myself);
- Create some new projects, preferably fun and helpful;
